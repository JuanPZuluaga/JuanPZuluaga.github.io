Here are some books I deeply recommend. During my Ph.D. studies, I went from reading barely one book per year, to read around 12 books over the last 9 months. You will find books from literary fiction to economics and even futuristic fiction!  


History, Social Philosophy and Debate
======

Here, my favorites are from [Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.ynharari.com/). They are a must-read for the XXI Century.
