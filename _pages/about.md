I am Ph.D. student at IDIAP jointly with the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)). I am working on a European Union Horizon 2020 project called [ATCO2](https://www.atco2.org/). It is dedicated to the development of an Automatic Air Traffic Speech Recognition system. Also, we aim at developing a unique platform allowing to collect, organize and pre-process air-traffic control (voice communication) data from air space (and yes! air traffic communications are very tough and the pilots talk super fast!).


Originally from Baranoa, Colombia. A tiny village in the North of Colombia (around 30 minutes from the Caribbean coast). I received a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering from [Universidad Autonoma del Caribe](https://www.uac.edu.co/) and an M.Sc. also in Mechatronics Engineering, but this time from [University of Oviedo](https://www.uniovi.es/en) in Spain.
