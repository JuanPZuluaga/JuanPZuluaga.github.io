I am Ph.D. student at IDIAP jointly with the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)). I am working on a European Union Horizon 2020 project called [ATCO2](https://www.atco2.org/). It is dedicated to the development of an Automatic Air Traffic Speech Recognition system. Also, we aim at developing a unique platform allowing to collect, organize and pre-process air-traffic control (voice communication) data from air space (and yes! air traffic communications are very tough and the pilots talk super fast!).


Originally from Baranoa, Colombia. A tiny village in the North of Colombia (around 30 minutes from the Caribbean coast). I received a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering from [Universidad Autonoma del Caribe](https://www.uac.edu.co/) and an M.Sc. also in Mechatronics Engineering, but this time from [University of Oviedo](https://www.uniovi.es/en) in Spain.

## Latest news


### 2021


- Out first paper submitted to [ICASSP 2022](https://2022.ieeeicassp.org/) is released in ArXiV:
  - BERTraffic: A Robust BERT-Based Approach for Speaker Change Detection and Role Identification of Air-Traffic Communications. 
  [abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05781), [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05781.pdf){: .notice}


- We submitted 3 papers to [ICASSP 2022](https://2022.ieeeicassp.org/) with Yulia, Amrutha and Saeed from our lab ([Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/en)). 

- Exciting news! our paper submitted [**The 9th OpenSky Symposium**](https://symposium.opensky-network.org/) was accepted for on-site presentation! (Automatic processing pipeline for collecting and annotating air-traffic voice communication data)

- The two papers presented at [Interspeech 2021](https://www.interspeech2021.org/) are:

- Exciting news! two of the four papers submitted to [Interspeech 2021](https://www.interspeech2021.org/) were accepted. 

- We submitted 4 papers to [Interspeech 2021](https://www.interspeech2021.org/) with Yulia and Amrutha from our lab ([Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/en)) and [Brno University of Technology](https://www.vut.cz/EN/).


### 2020

- Exciting news! our paper submitted [**The 8th OpenSky Symposium**](https://symposium.opensky-network.org/) was accepted for virtual presentation! (Automatic Call Sign Detection: Matching Air Surveillance Data with Air Traffic Spoken Communications)

- The full paper presented at [Interspeech 2020](https://www.interspeech2020.org/):
  - Automatic speech recognition benchmark for air-traffic communications.
  [abstract](https://isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2020/zuluagagomez20_interspeech.html)[PDF](https://isca-speech.org/archive/pdfs/interspeech_2020/zuluagagomez20_interspeech.pdf){: .notice}


- Exciting news! one paper submitted at [**Interspeech 2020**](http://www.interspeech2020.org/) was accepted for on-site presentation! (Automatic speech recognition benchmark for air-traffic communications)

- Really excited about my first paper about ASR for air-traffic control communications (low-resource task)! It was submitted at [Interspeech 2020](http://www.interspeech2020.org/). Addittionally, we submitted another work with Qingran Zhan from our lab ([Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/en)) about Articularatory features for ASR.


### 2019

- Time goes so fast! We just published a second Journal paper related to breast cancer diganosis with infrared techniques and maching learning (computer vision)! The paper was accepted for publication in the **Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging & Visualization**. 
[Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21681163.2020.1824685) and [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13757)

- Excited about my first Journal survey paper related to breast cancer diganosis techniques! The survey paper was published in the **Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology**. 
[Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03091902.2019.1664672) and [pre-print](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02387519/document)

- January: Started my Master Thesis at the École nationale supérieure de mécanique et des microtechniques in Besançon, France! I will work on computer vision for breast cancer diagnosis!
