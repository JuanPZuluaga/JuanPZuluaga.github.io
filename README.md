# Resume

I am Ph.D. student at IDIAP jointly with the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)). 
Currently, interning at AWS-AI in Seattle. Later, I will be interning at Apple in Boston!

My PhD initially targeted [ATCO2](https://www.atco2.org/) project. Mainly dedicated to the development of Robust Automatic Air Traffic Speech Recognition and Understanding system. We aimed at developing a unique platform allowing to collect, organize and pre-process air-traffic control (voice communication) data from air space (and yes! air traffic communications are very tough and the pilots talk super fast!). 

Feel free to fork this repository!
