# Resume

I'm a Senior Research Engineer working at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), with a strong focus on speech-and-audio LLMs. I’ve contributed to projects like HyperConformer for efficient ASR and STAC-ST for speech translation. My work spans spoken language understanding, LLMs, TTS/ASR model training, pseudo-labeling, and data generation/selection pipelines for model optimization.

Currently at Agigo AG, a Swiss AI company building next-generation autonomous AI-agents, I focus on 1) Scaling and deploying large acoustic and LLMs in production settings. 2) Generating high-quality synthetic conversational data for model training. 3) Maximizing GPU efficiency for multi-client inference workloads.

I'm passionate about bridging speech and language technologies for real-world, multimodal, and multilingual applications. I have also explored AI applications in biomedical imaging and intelligent human-machine communication.

I obtained a Ph.D. at IDIAP and École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)). I was also intern at AWS (Amazon) in Seattle and Apple in Boston in 2023!

My PhD initially targeted [ATCO2](https://www.atco2.org/) project. Mainly dedicated to the development of Robust Automatic Air Traffic Speech Recognition and Understanding system. We aimed at developing a unique platform allowing to collect, organize and pre-process air-traffic control (voice communication) data from air space (and yes! air traffic communications are very tough and the pilots talk super fast!).
