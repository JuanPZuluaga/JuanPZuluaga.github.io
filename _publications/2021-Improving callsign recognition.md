Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can be used as the as sistance of speech communication between pilots and air-traffic controllers. Its application can significantly reduce the complexity of the task and increase the reliability of transmitted information. Evidently, high accuracy predictions are needed to minimise the risk of errors. Especially, high accuracy is required in recognition of key information, such as commands and callsigns, used to navigate pilots.
